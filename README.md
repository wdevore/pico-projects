## Creating a new project and configuring.

- Create a new project folder under *pico-projects*.
- cd into new folder.
- Create *build* directory
- Create CMakeLists.txt
- Copy pico_sdk_import.cmake from pico-sdk/external
- Create your *main.c* file and update CMakeLists.txt
- **important** In VSCode, right-click on *CMakeLists.txt* file and *Configure All Projects*. This will configure things such as intellisence and such.

# 8.3. Automating project creation
The pico project generator, automatically creates a "stub" project with all the necessary files to allow it to build. If you
want to make use of this youâ€™ll need to go ahead and clone the project creation script from its Git repository,

```
$ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-project-generator.git
```
It can then be run in graphical mode,
```
$ cd pico-project-generator
$ ./pico_project.py --gui
```

which will bring up a GUI interface allowing you to configure your project

# Building for Picoprobe

- $ cd /media/iposthuman/Nihongo/Hardware/PicoRP2040/test/build/
- (*first time on a change*) cmake ..
- $ make -j4
